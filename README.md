These scripts are maybe useful, but they’re mostly my personal playground for practicing GNU/Linux and Bash.

As a web developer, I naturally ended up creating a utils folder and functions. 
If you ever see a components folder in the future, don’t be surprised. xD (jk... or am I?)

All scripts aim to be clean, modular, and probably over engineered for what they do.

Feel free to use them, break them, criticise them, or reach out if you have feedback.


## Scripts

- ### `diskaid.sh`  
  Performs health checks and basic repair operations on disk partitions using tools like `smartctl`, `fsck`, `xfs_repair`, and `ntfsfix`. Mostly used it to fix stupid Windows dirty NTFS mounts, I improved it a little bit more.


- ### `obscura.sh`
  Encrypts or decrypts strings and files using AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2, supporting both CLI and interactive modes, useful for encode/decode casual secrets.
    

- ### `backup-cron-worker.sh`
    TODO


- ### `dns-over-tls.sh`
    TODO


- ### `nvim-starter.sh`  
  Setup commonly used plugins and configs.
